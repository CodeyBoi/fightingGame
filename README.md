CONTROSL: XCVB UIOP to attack. down arrow for ult
if you want to play the game some other way than 1v1 with those controls you can look in the code. it says * HERE * somewhere. (also put all art in a folder maybe ( and name it on line 5 in code).)
also you can change fps if you are noob or pro.

its avery good game.(gg)


btw controls in menu are arrows and space but i might change that because irs very bad
